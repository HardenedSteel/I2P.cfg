### What this config do?
* All connection settings are pre-configured.
* Security level is "highest" as default but can be changed for current session.
* .I2P TLD is added. - So you don't have to add "http://" to every eepsite link.
* https-only mode disabled.
* The browser won't upgrade http to https - which not needed for eepsites.
